    <ol>
        <li>
            If the chiecken wings are whole, cut them into wings and drumettes and remove the tip.

        <li>
            Mix the Chicken stock powder, paprkia, chinese 5 spice, pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic granules into a bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
            In a large bowl add all the wings and drumettes and mix with a glug of oil, when everything is coated, tip in the bowl of mixed spices and mix until all wings are coated evenly. Leave to marinate.
        </li>
